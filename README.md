# External ADC Testing on ESP32 (C++)

This C++ script is developed to test an external Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. It reads ADC data, processes it, and utilizes C++ libraries for analysis and visualization.

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to validate and evaluate the performance of an external ADC integrated with an ESP32 microcontroller. Key functionalities include:

## How to Use

1. Set up your development environment with the ESP32 toolchain and necessary libraries.
2. Connect your external ADC to the ESP32 according to your hardware configuration.
3. Compile and upload the C++ script (`test-ADC-externe.cpp`) to your ESP32.
4. Run the script on the ESP32 to start testing the external ADC.


## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have the required C++ libraries installed for ESP32 development.
- Customize the script (`test-ADC-externe.cpp`) according to your specific ADC and ESP32 setup.
- Adapt the visualization and analysis methods based on the data retrieved from the ADC.
